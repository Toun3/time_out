					<h2>All Star Game 2020</h2>
					<h4>16 Février 2020, ESPN</h4>

					<p>The 2020 NBA All-Star Game was an exhibition game played on February 16, 2020. It was the 69th edition of the event. The game was held at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, home of the Chicago Bulls. This was the third time that Chicago hosted the All-Star Game. The other two times, in 1973 and 1988, the game was played at Chicago Stadium, the Bulls' previous home arena. The game was televised nationally by TNT for the 18th consecutive year.<br>
					It was announced on January 30, 2020, that the game would use a new format. The first three quarters were individually scored as separate games, with the scoreboard resetting after each quarter. The team that won each quarter got $100,000 for their team's charity; if tied, the total was added to the pot for the next quarter. At the end of the third quarter, the cumulative score was posted on the scoreboard, and the entire period was played under The Basketball Tournament's Elam Ending, a rule recommended by players' union president Chris Paul, who coached in the aforementioned tournament in 2019, for the entire quarter. The NBA All-Star Game's Elam Ending used a target score of 24 points more than the leading team's or both teams' score in honour of Kobe Bryant, who died on January 26, 2020. The winning team won $200,000 for their charity. If one team had won each of the first three quarters and reached the target score first, $500,000 would have been donated to the winning team's charity and $100,000 would have been donated to the losing team's charity.

					To further honor Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna, who died with him in the Calabasas helicopter crash, players on Team LeBron wore #2 (Gianna's basketball number) and players on Team Giannis wore #24 (Bryant's number from 2006-2016).

					Team LeBron won the 1st quarter, and Team Giannis won the 2nd quarter, and the 3rd quarter was tied, so the $100,000 was carried over to the 4th quarter, for a total of $300,000 on the line in the final quarter. Team Giannis led the cumulative score 133-124, so per the rules of the Elam Ending, the teams played to a target score of 157.

					Anthony Davis scored the final point for Team LeBron on a free throw to win the game, 157-155, in a back-and-forth untimed 4th quarter, which featured multiple defensive plays. The Elam Ending format was well-received, by both fans and players alike.

					Kawhi Leonard of Team LeBron was awarded the NBA All-Star Game Kobe Bryant Most Valuable Player award.<br><br>ESPN
